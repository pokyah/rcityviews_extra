\title{Custom City View with Aspect Ratio and Orientation}
\usage{
cityview_with_aspect_ratio(
  name,
  country,
  border = "square",
  paper_format = "A4",
  orientation = "portrait",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character. The name of the city to be plotted.}

\item{country}{Character. The country where the city is located.}

\item{border}{Character. The border shape for the map. Options include `"square"` (default) and `"rectangle"`.}

\item{paper_format}{Character. The paper format to determine the aspect ratio. Supported formats include `"A4"`, `"A3"`, `"Letter"`, `"Legal"`, and `"Square"`.}

\item{orientation}{Character. The orientation of the paper format. Options are `"portrait"` (default) and `"landscape"`.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `cityview()` from the `rcityviews` package.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the map with the specified aspect ratio, orientation, and border.
}
\description{
A wrapper function around `cityview()` that allows users to specify an aspect ratio based on common paper formats, orientation (portrait or landscape), and a custom rectangular border shape.
}
\details{
This function modifies the aspect ratio of the map output based on the selected `paper_format` and `orientation`, keeping the plotted shapes centered. The `"rectangle"` border option produces a rectangular bounding box around the city, which can be oriented as either horizontal or vertical based on the `orientation` parameter.

Supported paper formats and their aspect ratios:
- `"A4"`: 1 / sqrt(2)
- `"A3"`: 1 / sqrt(2)
- `"Letter"`: 1 / 1.294
- `"Legal"`: 1 / 1.647
- `"Square"`: 1
}
\examples{
# Plot a city view with A4 landscape orientation and rectangle border
map <- cityview_with_aspect_ratio(
  name = "Paris",
  country = "France",
  border = "rectangle",
  paper_format = "A4",
  orientation = "landscape",
  theme = "default"
)
print(map)
